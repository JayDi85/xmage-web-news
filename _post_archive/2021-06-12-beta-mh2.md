title: Modern Horizons 2 final countdown
---

Almost all new cards from upcoming set [Modern Horizons 2](https://github.com/magefree/mage/issues/7807)
already available in the [BETA server](https://xmage.today/). The server supports playing against both players and computer/AI.
Try the new version and report any bugs on [github](https://github.com/magefree/mage/issues).

It would be great if you could help find bugs before release.

If you like the project then you can support it by [donate or patreon](https://xmage.today/#donate).
