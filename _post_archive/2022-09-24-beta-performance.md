title: Beta server improved
---
Beta server updated with improved hardware, so it must work faster with more stability.
If you want to play with computer (AI) then run local server from the launcher.

Please try new beta version in the [BETA server](http://xmage.today/) 
and report any bugs on [github](https://github.com/magefree/mage/issues).

It would be great if you could help find bugs before release.

If you like the project then you can support it by [donate or patreon](http://xmage.today/#donate).
