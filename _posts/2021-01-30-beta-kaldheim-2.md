[Kaldheim](https://github.com/magefree/mage/issues/7248) set now fully implemented 
and already available in the [BETA server](http://xmage.today/) with [20+ new GUI features](https://github.com/magefree/mage/pull/7467) like card icons.
The server supports playing against both players and computer/AI.
Try the new version and report any bugs on [github](https://github.com/magefree/mage/issues).

It would be great if you could help find bugs before release.

If you like the project then you can support it by [donate or join to patreon](http://xmage.today/#donate) to read news and stories about xmage's development process.
