title: Server Stability Reaches New Heights ðŸš€ ðŸŽ‰
---
The public server has now run flawlessly for over 10 days straight multiple times, most recently handling 24,000+ games and 700+ tournaments without a single restart! ðŸ’ª

This is the longest uninterrupted uptime weâ€™ve ever achievedâ€”a major milestone!

Over the past year, weâ€™ve dedicated significant effort to code optimization and server stability improvements, and now weâ€™re seeing the results. This record uptime proves our progress! âœ¨

Thank you for your patience and support. More upgrades coming soon! ðŸ˜Š
